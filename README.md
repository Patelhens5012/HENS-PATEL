All About Me...
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Hens Patel, a passionate student with a keen interest in DevOps and cloud computing. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

ðŸŽ“ Currently pursuing my Bachelor at Charusat University, I am actively exploring various aspects of the DevOps culture and cloud technologies. I am fascinated by the intersection of software development, system administration, and infrastructure automation.

ðŸ’¡ My GitHub repositories reflect my journey as I dive deeper into the world of DevOps. You'll find projects related to CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-code, containerization, and cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

ðŸ”§ I enjoy working with popular DevOps tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform, and Jenkins. Through my projects, I aim to showcase my ability to automate deployments, streamline software delivery, and improve overall system reliability.

ðŸŒ± I'm always eager to learn and expand my knowledge in this dynamic field. Currently, I'm focusing on enhancing my skills in cloud-native architectures, serverless computing, and managing infrastructure at scale.

ðŸ“š Apart from coding, I'm also an avid reader of DevOps and cloud-related books and blogs. I love to stay updated with the latest industry trends, best practices, and emerging technologies.

âœ¨ I'm open to collaboration and actively seeking opportunities to contribute to open-source projects in the DevOps and cloud computing space. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any interesting projects or ideas you'd like to discuss.

ðŸ“« You can connect with me on LinkedIn to explore potential collaborations or simply have a chat about all things DevOps and cloud!

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. Let's automate and transform the world together! ðŸ˜„ðŸš€
